{{% notice info%}}
We recommended to run this workshop on **local environment**.
If you have difficulty setting up `Node.js` or `npm` in your local environment, you can use [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cloud9/), which is the cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) provided by AWS.
For more information, see [10.1. Set up AWS Cloud9](/en/100_supplemental_resource/10_cloud9.html).
However, for Amplify Mocking, port 20002 must be available and may not be available in some Cloud IDEs.
Please understand in advance.

{{% notice tip%}}
If you are familiar with Docker and Visual Studio Code, 
you can use Visual Studio Code's Remote Container; [aws-amplify-sns-workshop-in-vscode](https://github.com/toricls/aws-amplify-sns-workshop-in-vscode) instead of using local environment.
If you use this, you can skip "Installing Node.js/npm", "Installing Java" and "Installing Amplify CLI" in this section.
{{% /notice %}}

Before you start coding, you should install, update, and configure some software.

### Installing Node.js/npm
The Amplify CLI recommends 10.x for Node.js and 6.x or later versions for npm.
This section confirms that the recommended version of Amplify is installed in your environment.
Only those who need to install Node.js/npm are required to perform the installation procedure.

1. In order to check the version, execute the following command in Terminal.
```
node -v; npm -v
# The following is an example of the execution result.
v12.16.1 #<- Node.js version
6.13.4 #<- npm version
```
2. If you are using Node.js 10.x or later, please proceed to the next section.
3. If you are using a version earlier than Node.js 10.x, or if you do not have Node.js installed, you can follow the steps below to install or update Node.js.
  - [MacOS Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)
  - [Windows Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)
  - [Amazon Linux Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html)
4. Make sure that the installation is finished.
```
node -v; npm -v
```

{{% notice tip%}}
npm, a package management tool, is installed automatically when you install Node.js

### Installing Java
Amplify Mocking requires the Java runtime since OpenJDK 1.8.
This section makes sure that the version of Java required by Amplify Mocking is installed in your environment.
Only those who need to install Java are required to perform the Java installation procedure.

1. Verifying the Java version
```
java -version
# The following is an example of the execution result.
openjdk version "1.8.0_232"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-8.232.09.1 (build 1.8.0_232-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-8.232.09.1 (build 25.232-b09, mixed mode)
```
2. If you are using OpenJDK 1.8 or later, please proceed to the next section.
3. If you are using OpenJDK 1.7 or earlier, or if you do not have Java installed, you can follow the steps below to install or update Java. In this workshop, you use [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/), which is the free, production-ready OpenJDK Distribution provided by AWS.
  - [MacOS Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/macos-install.html)
  - [Windows Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/windows-7-install.html)
  - [Amazon Linux Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/linux-info.html)
1. Make sure that the installation is finished.
```
java -version
```

{{% notice tip%}}
If the package management tool `brew` is installed on macOS, it can be installed with `$ brew cask install corretto`.

### Installing Amplify CLI
To install the Amplfiy CLI, execute the following command in Terminal.

```bash
# Install the AWS Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli@4.45.0
```

{{% notice warning%}}
If you are already using Amplify CLI, please reinstall it according to the version specified.
{{% /notice%}}

### Configuring Amplify CLI
This workshop builds the backend using Amplify CLI. You create an IAM user and set credentials to allow Amplify CLI to connect to the backend.

```sh
amplify configure
```

When you execute the `amplify configure` command, you see "Sign in to your AWS administrator account:"

{{% notice info%}}
You may be prompted to log in as the root user, but you do not need to be the root user.
Log in as an IAM user who can create an IAM user with the privileges required by Amplify.
{{% /notice%}}


Press Enter and you are prompted for the Region or IAM user name to use. Select `us-east-1` for the Region, and all others specify the default.


A URL is issued starting with https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/~~, and you are able to access it in another browser.

If the URL is not issued, please access [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=undefined#/users$new?step=details&accessKey&permissionType=policies&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess).

Follow the navigation of the screen to create an IAM user. You do not need to change any choices or settings.

{{% notice warning %}}
IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` is granted strong authority.
For example, you can create new EC2 instances and view files in S3.
Prease be careful not to upload credentials to GitHub.
If you don't need to remain IAM user, we recommend to delete IAM user. ([Deleting an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting))
Or, you can grant limited authority which is required in this workshop as mentioned in tips section below.
Or, you can use IAM Role and MFA instead of IAM user securely. ([IAM Roles & MFA](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/usage/iam-roles-mfa))
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip%}}
If you do not want to create an IAM user with Admin privileges, please visit 
[10.3 IAM Policy](../100_supplemental_resource/30_iam_policy.html)
and create an IAM policy.
{{% /notice%}}


1. Create a user ![create iam user](/images/00_prequisites/iam-1-create-user.png)
2. Attach IAM policies ![attach policy](/images/00_prequisites/iam-2-attach-policy.png)
3. Add tagas (option)
4. Review settings ![confirm](/images/00_prequisites/iam-3-create-user.png)
5. Complete user creation (**Please do not close this screen!**) ![confirm](/images/00_prequisites/iam-4-save-url.png)


Return to Terminal and press Enter. Access Key ID and Secret Access Key ID are asked to enter. Please copy those IDs that appear on the IAM User Creation Complete screen in your browser. <br>
You can leave `Profile Name` as the default (`default`), but for later clarity, we recommend you to use `amplify-handson` here.


![inputcredentials.jpg](/images/00_prequisites/inputcredentials.jpg)

Please make sure that "Successfully set up the new user." is appeared on the console.
You can now issue commands from Amplify CLI with the privileges of the IAM user you created.

{{% notice tip%}}
If [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) is installed, you can also check the Profile created with the following command.
(If not installed, you do not need to check it.)
{{% /notice%}}

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile amplify-handson
{
  "UserId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "Account": "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam·ç¢ YYYYYYYYYYYYYY:user/amplify-ZZZZZ"
}
```
